Educational project on compiler writing using Rust. Will eventually compile down to MSIL maybe native. Syntax will be a hybrid between Rust and C#. This is a relatively naive implementation.

## Current Progress
Currently trying to extract out tokens from source code. 

## Planned Features
- async/await
- Options, no nulls
- Inbuilt Tuples
- Rust style error/exception handling
- Pattern matching
- Ownership/borrowing/lifetimes?
- Syntax tree visualiser
