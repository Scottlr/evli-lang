# Fier Language
Educational project on compiler writing in Rust, eventually will compile down to MSIL maybe native, depends on how much research I can manage to fit in :)
Syntax will be a hybrid between Rust and C#:


## Planned Features
- async/await
- Options, no nulls
- Tuples inbuilt
- Rust style error/exception handling
- Pattern matching
- Ownership/borrowing?
- Syntax tree visualiser
